# Admission Mechanism

TODO:
- split files into multiple ones
- implement the school-optimal stable mechanism
- figure out how to output it into legible html tables with coloring etc
  - will it have to be mechanism specific or can I figure out sth generic?

- how to handle logging? should I just inject an optional logger into mechanisms?
  - and it will be invoked on start, on every step and on end?
  - that sounds quite sensible
